*** Notes from ServiceNow Scripting Lesson ***

Client Script Types (Forms)

A Client Script executes client-side script logic when forms are:
 - Loaded
 - Changed
 - Submitted

onLoad - execute script logic when forms are loaded. Use it to manipulate a form's appearance or content. Use onLoad sparingly as they impact form load times.

onChange - execute script logic when a particular field's value changes. Use it to respond to field values of interest and to modify another field's value or attributes.


onSubmit - execute script logic when a form is submitted. Use it to validate field values. Script can prevent writing to DB and return control to user.
